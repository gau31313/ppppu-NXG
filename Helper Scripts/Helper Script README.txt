The helper scripts are written to not be ran from the folder containing them. The svg converter and make gradient resource scripts should be ran with the current work directory being the folder containing the svg files. All the other scripts should be ran from the project's root folder (which contains the project.godot). I recommend created a symlink/shortcut to the scripts and placing them in the directory that you want the scripts to work on.
